## Set Up
For running the project make sure you have Angular v18.
For installing Angular LTS (v18) run:
```
  @npm i @angular/cli
```
And for installing the project dependencies run:
```
  @npm i
```
Later to run the project in a dev server run:
```
  ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (default). The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
